# Deep Reinforcement Learning on MountainCar-v0 

Project work for "Autonomous and Adaptive Systems" (held by Prof. Mirco Musolesi) University of Bologna.

The goal of this project is to compare, from a performance point of view, three different implementation of one of the most common reinforcement learning algorithms: Deep Q-Learning. 
In particular, simple DQN, DQN with Fixed Q-targets,and Double-DQN were chosen. 
The results showed that although all three imple-mentations solved the environment under consideration, the two optimizations of the base algorithm led to better results.
